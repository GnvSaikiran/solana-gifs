# Naruto Gifs

This project uses React for frontend. This Dapp runs on Solana blockchain. The Solana program is written using Rust.

You can submit your favourite gifs and other users can see them by connecting their solana wallet to the web app. All the users will be able to see the public address of the user who submitted the gif.

[You can found the frontend code here](https://replit.com/@gnv24/gif-portal-starter-project)
